SEED2NEED Core version *5.6.0* is now available from:  <https://github.com/seed2need-project/seed2need/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/seed2need-project/seed2need/issues>

Mandatory Update
==============

SEED2NEED Core v5.6.0 is a mandatory update for all users. This release contains new consensus rules and improvements that are not backwards compatible with older versions. Users will need to update their clients before enforcement of this update goes into effect.

Exchange address activation is scheduled to go into effect at the following time:

```
Mainnet: block 4,281,680. ~Feb 29th 2024.
```
Masternodes will need to be restarted from the controller wallet once both the masternode daemon and the controller wallet have been upgraded.

Note: In preparation for the new address type activation, upgraded peers will start rejecting non-upgraded peers a few days before the exchange address activation block height noted above, we recommend everyone to be updated at least a week prior to this time.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/SEED2NEED-Qt (on Mac) or seed2needd/seed2need-qt (on Linux).

Notable Changes
==============

### New Exchange Address Type

A new address type has been added for use by exchanges that require additional regulatory compliance. This new "exchange address" functions similarly to a regular SEED2NEED address, but with one distinct difference; transactions originating from a SHIELD address are not allowed to be sent to said exchange addresses.

Creation of these new exchange addresses is available via the new `getnewexchangeaddress` RPC command. It takes an optional `label (string)` to set a label for the address if necessary. Functionality is the same comparatively to `getnewaddress`, `getnewstakingaddress` and `getnewshieldaddress`

| Command Name | Purpose | Requires Unlocked Wallet? |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------- |
| `getnewexchangeaddress` | Creates a new exchange address | Yes |

Command is detailed below:

* `getnewexchangeaddress`
  ```
  Returns a new exchange address for receiving payments.
  Result:
  "address"    (string) The new exchange address.
  ```

### Use Coin Control for masternode collateral creation

It is now possible to use the GUI's Coin Control feature to manually select which inputs you would like to use when creating a new masternode. The previous functionality of automatically selecting sufficient inputs remains however.

### Generate a proposal payout address on-the-fly

Proposal creators can now choose to generate a new SEED2NEED address to be used as a proposal's payout address directly within the proposal creation wizard.

### Lockable sapling notes (SHIELD UTXOs)

The ability to "lock" SHIELD UTXOs has been added to both the RPC's `lockunspent` command as well as the GUI's Coin Control interface. This brings feature parity between SHIELD and Transparent UTXOs.

### startmasternode RPC command cleanup

The `startmasternode` RPC command has had some long-time non-working options removed as part of a cleanup. Notably; the `local` and `many` options no longer exist. This is not a change in functionality, as both options have essentially done nothing for quite some time, and only led to confusion amongst users.
